# dataset_testing_recognition_tools
This repository contains three datasets (main dataset represented as 2 parts)consisting of images of structural formulas of molecules, as well as a file containing smiles notations for these structuratics with and without chirality. A file with the results of testing several optical molecule recognition tools on this dataset is also presented.
